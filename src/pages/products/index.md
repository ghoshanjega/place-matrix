  Through our varied backgrounds we seek to passionately integrate innovative
  research practices with traditional methods of urban design and master
  planning. Working closely with designers, planners and institutes, we offer
  services related to 3-dimensional spatial network analysis that can plug-in
  into their workflow and allow them to explore a variety of evidence-based best
  option scenarios.

        He is a trained urban designer with experience of working on
        multi-scalar projects across China, Hong Kong, Middle-east, Russia and
        India. Through his experience in the field so far he has realised that
        in order to add value to design there is a need for an injection of
        innovative research practices in urban design. Through 3-dimensional
        spatial network analysis, this integration of research and practice to
        add new values is exactly what he’s set out to achieve.
